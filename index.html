        <h1 class="text">About me!</h1>
       
        <p class="text"> 
            I have been passionate about programming since I was first introduced to it in middle
            school through various robotics camps and my participation in the UTSA Prefreshman Engineering Program program.
            Since coming to St. Mary's, I have made sure that I am involved on campus through clubs and organizations.
            I am currently the Vice President for the Infinite Loops computer science club, a team manager
            for our Esports program, and a member of the Esports broadcast team.
            <br>
            <br>
            Through these positions I help organize activites for our members and volunteer at various events throughout the year.
            With my passion for programming, I worked as a tech assistant for the SET tech Camps St. Mary's holds in the summer 
            and got to help cultivate an interest in computer science in high school students local to San Antonio.
            It is very important to me to give back to my community and I hope to continue helping others in my career.
